## Overview
This is a solution to the [QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). The project displays a responsive QR code card that links to Frontend Mentor, built with HTML and CSS, focusing on accessibility and cross-platform compatibility.

## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for responsive layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (`Outfit` font)
- `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings

### What I Learned
- **Responsive Design**: Using Flexbox to center the QR code card and a mobile-first approach with media queries (`@media (min-width: 375px)`) ensured a consistent layout across devices.
- **Accessibility**: Adding `<main>` and `<footer>` landmarks resolved accessibility warnings (`landmark-one-main` and `region`), improving semantic structure for screen readers.
- **Git Management**: Resolved divergent branch issues using `git pull --no-rebase` and normalized line endings with `.gitattributes` to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

### Continued Development
In future projects, I plan to:
- Incorporate ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility.
- Experiment with CSS animations (e.g., hover effects) for better interactivity.
- Optimize Google Fonts loading with preloading or fallback strategies.
